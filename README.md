I have performed a comprehensive analysis on a synthetic dataset representing 100,000 ride bookings in Bengaluru for one month. The dataset included detailed columns such as booking status, vehicle type, locations, ride timings, cancellations by both drivers and customers, incomplete rides, booking value, payment methods, and ride ratings.
Key project activities included:
Data cleaning and preparation to ensure realistic booking success and cancellation rates.
Writing SQL queries to extract insights such as total successful bookings, average ride distances by vehicle type, cancellation counts by customers and drivers, top customers by ride frequency and booking value, and payment method analysis.
Building Power BI dashboards visualizing ride volume over time, booking status breakdown, vehicle type performance, cancellation reasons, revenue by payment method, and customer vs. driver ratings.
SQL views were created for efficient querying and reporting of various analytics points.
Insights were drawn to assess customer behavior, driver performance, and revenue trends based on the dataset.

This project demonstrated your skills in SQL data querying, data visualization with Power BI, and interpreting ride-sharing business metrics for operational and strategic decision-making. It also showcased your ability to manage and analyze large-scale ride booking datasets with multiple variables in a business context.
